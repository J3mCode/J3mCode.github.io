            Hi, I'm Jacqui. Welcome to this brief introduction into my
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started out in the science field by studying Ecology at Colorado
            State University (CSU). I took up many extracurriculars such as
            wildlife clubs and ACSU the student body government. I participated
            in two research conferences where I conducted and presented my own
            studies; The Front Range Ecology Symposium, and the Celebrate
            Undergraduate Research and Creativity (CURC) Showcase. During my
            final year in college I had my first exposure to the world of data science.
             I worked as a research assistant to a Graduate
            student and used python to create an interactive, data
            model. This is what sparked my interest in Data Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating I took time to take some coursework in computer
            science to learn some basic technical and programming skills. I am
            currently working on a certification in full stack software
            development to strengthen my coding and project management knowledge
            while also working on side projects in data science for practice.
            The next goal is a Masters in Datascience at Georgia Tech.
